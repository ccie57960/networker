# networker
Some useful methods/functions/library related to networking written in Python.

The plan is to practice (scripting, network automation).
Feel free to use, modify, share it. Any feedback would be appreciated :D

I'm including a folder/directory per subproject as follow:

## Directories Structure:
+ **dijkstra**: my implementation of Dijkstra SPT algorithm including end-to-end ECMP. [For more detail click here](https://github.com/ccie57960/networker/blob/master/dijkstra/README.md)

+ **netwoker_methods**: I'm creating a library with some useful methods related to networking.[For more detail click here](https://github.com/ccie57960/networker/blob/master/networker_methods/README.md)


If you want to say thanks, just say "thnx" or provide any feedback. Also you could optionally donate (https://www.paypal.me/57960)

Hope this may help you.
